# Horiseon
This project is a mock-up for a homepage for Horiseon, a fictional online brand/reputation management firm. This was an assignment for a coding bootcamp; we were given an already-constructed web page and told to refactor the HTML and CSS for improved accessibility and readability. This was accomplished by updating the HTML to use modern semantic tags, removing unnecessary classes, reorganizing and consolidating CSS declarations, and adding comments to both files.
